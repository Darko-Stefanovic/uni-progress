          <p>
            The EdTech Talents project (Project: 101119689 — EdTech Talents —
            HORIZON-WIDERA-2022-TALENTS-03) aims to make education and
            technology work together better in Estonia, Hungary, and Serbia. We
            want to help academic and support staff in these countries learn
            from successful EdTech companies in Austria, Germany, and Spain. At
            the same time, researchers from these advanced countries will share
            their expertise and knowledge with EdTech companies in Estonia,
            Hungary, and Serbia. We’re doing this by giving guidance and
            training so that good ideas and knowledge can flow between everyone
            involved. This lines up with a bigger plan for cooperation and
            talent circulation between different sectors and countries to make
            education and business connections stronger.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a part of this project a blockchain based solution for tracking
            academic progression has been developed.

          <h2>Blockchain Based Solution for Tracking Academic Progression</h2>
          <p>
            Monitoring students’ academic progress throughout their studies is
            becoming increasingly critical in modern higher education. Today’s
            academic environment requires transparency, reliability, and
            verifiable records of student achievements. However, most
            universities maintain enrollment and graduation data internally,
            without a unified, tamper-proof system that prevents manipulation or
            forgery. This lack of robust infrastructure creates opportunities
            for individuals to exploit administrative gaps and obtain academic
            credentials without meeting all required obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project proposes a blockchain-based solution designed to
            securely track every stage of a student’s academic journey—from
            their initial enrollment to final graduation. Each academic year,
            along with completed courses and passed examinations, is recorded on
            a decentralized ledger that ensures immutability, transparency, and
            resistance to unauthorized alterations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system also incorporates a built-in rule enforcing a minimum
            duration of study between enrollment and graduation. This prevents
            the issuance of degrees through accelerated or improper pathways and
            ensures that only students who follow the full curriculum earn valid
            credentials.
          </p>
          <p>
            By leveraging blockchain technology, universities gain a trusted
            mechanism for maintaining authentic academic records, while
            restoring confidence in the integrity of the educational process. A
            simple and secure web interface allows universities, employers, and
            other stakeholders to quickly verify a student’s academic history
            and confirm the legitimacy of their qualifications.
